First off, thanks for being interested in contributing!

There are no formal requirements for contributing beyond ensuring the project works after your changes are made.

After you have validated that the project builds and runs please feel free to submit a pull request to be reviewed. It is important to outline all of the changes you made in order to expedite the review process.

I have two small children so it can sometimes take me a but to respond to all the github communications but I will review it ASAP.

Thanks and happy coding!
